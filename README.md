Socio-Matrix: A Social Media Analysis Tool
Institution: Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India

This repository contains the final year research paper titled "Socio-Matrix" developed as part of the Information Science program. The paper presents Socio-Matrix, a powerful social media analysis tool designed to analyze user activity, gather metadata, and identify suspicious behaviors across multiple platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.

Abstract:

The rise of cybercrime, cyberbullying, and misinformation necessitates efficient tools to investigate malicious activities with minimal initial information. Socio-Matrix is a CLI and web-based application designed to facilitate social media investigations by gathering and analyzing data such as user profiles, followers, posts, and hashtag usage from over 800 websites. The paper outlines the methodology for collecting, processing, and analyzing public social media data, highlighting its potential for investigating cybercrimes, identifying behavioral patterns, and conducting network analysis.

Key Features:

Username Enumeration: Gathers publicly available data on user profiles across platforms.
Hashtag Analysis: Identifies trending hashtags, popular users, and user engagement related to specific topics.
Post Metadata Collection: Extracts key details such as likes, comments, and timestamps from social media posts.
Network Analysis: Reveals relationships and patterns between users based on their interactions (e.g., retweets, mentions).
Custom Plugins: Extend the toolâ€™s functionality by creating plugins to perform specific tasks, such as tracking post engagement.
Technologies Used:

Python for backend services and CLI
Node.js and Express.js for web application functionality
APIs (e.g., Instagram Graph API, Twitter API) for data extraction
Libraries such as Flask, Cheerio, and Puppeteer for web scraping and data collection
JSON for data conversion
Visualization tools like NetworkX, Matplotlib, D3.js, and Plotly
Future Work:

Further advancements in the field of social media analysis can be explored, including more sophisticated algorithms for deeper insights and the expansion of analysis capabilities to more platforms.

Conclusion:

The tool provides significant insights into user behavior and social media trends, offering valuable applications for businesses, law enforcement agencies, and researchers. While it is currently dependent on public APIs, future work will aim to develop more advanced methodologies to improve data collection and analysis.
